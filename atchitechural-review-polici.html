												(6) the proposed manner of installation of the Hurricane Shutter.</li>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												<strong>Style.</strong>  The acceptable styles of hurricane shutters
												are: </li>
										</ol>
										<ul>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												Rolling shutters, such as Rollex or Roll-a-Way;</li>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												Accordion shutters; </li>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												Clear polycarbonate panels; or</li>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												Corrugated metal panels.</li>
										</ul>
										<ol>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												<strong>Color.</strong>  White shutters are preferred.  The shutter
												frames must be painted to match the wall on which they are installed. 
												Please contact the Association for details.</li>
										</ol>
										<ul>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												If the shutters will be left in place for a prolonged period of time,
												for example when the owner is out of town or for the duration of the
												hurricane season, they must be white.  If the shutters are not white,
												they can be deployed short term (as described below), or they can be
												painted white for long-term deployment.</li>
										</ul>
										<ol>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												<strong>Length of Time.</strong>  Window coverings that do not meet the
												Style criteria (see above) may only be put in place when a NOAA Named
												Storm is approaching our area and within 300 miles radius, and the
												coverings may only remain in place for 14 days after the storm has
												passed. This applies to each occurrence of a NOAA Named Storm during the
												hurricane season.</li>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												<strong>Maintenance.</strong>  The maintenance and appearance of
												hurricane shutters shall be the responsibility of the individual
												homeowner. The owner of the unit to which the Hurricane Shutter is
												installed shall be liable for any and all damage to the common elements,
												Association property or the property of other owners arising out of or
												concerning the construction, installation or maintenance of the
												Hurricane Shutter.</li>
											<li
												style="font-size: 12px; font-family: 'Times New Roman'; color: rgb(0, 0, 0);">
												<strong>Removal of Shutters.</strong> Unit owner agrees to be
												responsible for all costs of removal and reinstallation of the Hurricane
												Shutters, or any portion thereof, if necessary, to allow the Association
												to fulfill its maintenance, repair and replacement duties of common
												elements. Owner further agrees that in the event that noncompliant
												hurricane shutters are removed, such hurricane shutters shall not be
												reinstalled.</li>

											<span style="text-decoration: underline;"><strong>17. Security
													Cameras</strong></span><strong>.</strong> Installation of a home

											requests to install cameras in areas which include on the roof, soffits,
											fascia, window/door trim, and other exterior surfaces of the building
